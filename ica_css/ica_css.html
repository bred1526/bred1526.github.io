<h6>Reflection:</h6> 
My color and typography represents my personal identity for various reasons. Iâ€™ve always liked the colors grey and blue since I was a kid, and the Payne's gray fits this perfectly. In recent years, purple has become my favorite color, as I find it to be very visually pleasing to look at. The font represents me because it is sans serif and smooth, which represents my laid back nature as a person.
The accessibility requirements influenced my design decisions by forcing me to look outside of what is simply visually pleasing to me, and find something that is accessible, visually pleasing to me, and also personal to my identity. The challenges I faced balancing personal expression and accessibility came down to the contrasts of the colors. I personally like lighter pastel colors matched with darker ones, which becomes difficult when trying to ensure proper contrasting.
The thing that surprised me the most about creating a cohesive design system is that there is a lot of trial and error. Not only is this the case with color coordinating background and text displays, but also with sizing and spacing of text. When variably changing the size of the headings, the amount of space between the lines seems larger due to the different text/padding size ratios. This is something that needed to be fixed by ensuring the padding also had a ratio set to it.
I might expand this in the future by intentionally varying the side of line spacing or maybe being more selective about the color choices I make. I could mix in match colors whose hues are visually pleasing and contrasts are accessible. I think the aspects of my system that feel least flexible are using colors that are similar hues, because they require such a stark brightness shift.
